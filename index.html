          <p>Humans and other animals learn from an early age how their surrounding environment evolves. Through the accumulation of knowledge about the external world, they gain the ability to predict what is happening around them. Similarly, world models enable machines to simulate, predict, and interact intelligently with their environments. These models serve as internal representations of the external world, allowing systems to understand environmental dynamics, anticipate outcomes, and make informed decisions. In this talk, we will explore what world models are, how they are built, why they are integral to advancing AI capabilities, and some open challenges. We will delve into popular architectures such as DeepMind‚Äôs Dreamer, DIAMOND, and GAIA, highlighting how these frameworks model complex environments. Additionally, we will examine the transformative applications of world models across diverse domains, including autonomous driving, robotics, 3D world simulations, and gaming. By connecting theory to real-world implementations, this talk aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to world models and their pivotal role in shaping the future of intelligent systems.</p>

This lack of control has led to significant privacy concerns, such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a paradigm shift that decentralizes Digital Identity by giving control back to the individuals it refers to. In SSI, individuals are called Holders and can decide what parts of their identity to expose. Each Holder has Verifiable Credentials (e.g., degree) in their digital wallet, issued by entities called Issuers (e.g., University). Holders present those Verifiable Credentials to any subject interested in information about them and who can act as a Verifier (e.g., recruiter). Unfortunately, no consolidated solutions exist to certify the Issuer's trustworthiness in issuing a specific credential or that the Holder can trust the Verifier in managing their sensitive data. How do we ensure that Issuers are trustworthy and Verifiers are competent to handle sensitive data responsibly? We will see some proposed methods for this and evaluate their suitability for different scenarios. Resolving these issues is essential to fully realizing the potential of SSI and creating a more secure, user-centric Digital Identity ecosystem.</p>

However, these models are prone to generating Hallucinations, which are factually incorrect, misleading, and non-sensical outputs that are presented in a convincingly accurate manner. This phenomenon poses significant risks, particularly in fields such as healthcare, legal services, etc. This seminar will briefly present the nature of hallucinations in LLMs, their underlying causes, and the challenges in detecting them. By understanding and preventing hallucination, LLM reliability can be improved, ensuring safer and more trustworthy AI applications.</p>

It builds on insights challenging traditional benchmarks and posits that true intelligence lies in an agent‚Äôs ability to rapidly learn and generalise from minimal exposure, as opposed to performing well only on predefined tasks with extensive training data. The ARC Benchmark presents abstract, open-ended problems designed to test human-like reasoning and adaptability, while the ARC Prize incentivises interdisciplinary approaches that blend rigorous theoretical analysis with practical data-driven approaches. Together, they tackle challenges such as scalability, inherent randomness and non-determinism, catalysing a paradigm shift toward AI systems that embody generalisable intelligence.</p>

Despite the use of technology, this right is not guaranteed for everyone, especially people with disabilities. Designing eHealth systems for people with disabilities requires an interdisciplinary approach and a balance between personalization and universality. We have technologies, methods and tools to develop systems that solve specific access problems in healthcare. However, to achieve universal products and reduce costs, the results of these efforts must be generalized. This seminar addresses the challenges and opportunities in developing inclusive eHealth systems and emphasizes the importance of a participatory approach to improve the accessibility and quality of healthcare for all.</p>

However, software engineering solutions for designing and developing carbon-efficient software are currently scattered in different literature, making it difficult to consult the body of knowledge on the topic. This seminar presents the results of a systematic literature review of state-of-the-art proposals for the design and development of carbon-efficient software. The analysis is based on the identification of 65 primary studies by classifying them through a taxonomy aimed at answering the 5W1H questions of carbon-efficient software design and development. Specifically, it provides a reasoned overview and discussion of the existing guidelines, reference models, measurement solutions and techniques for measuring, reducing, or minimising the carbon footprint of software. Finally, open challenges and research gaps are listed to provide insights for future work in this area.</p>
