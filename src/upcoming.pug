        | Humans and other animals learn from an early age how their surrounding environment evolves. Through the accumulation of knowledge about the external world, they gain the ability to predict what is happening around them. Similarly, world models enable machines to simulate, predict, and interact intelligently with their environments. These models serve as internal representations of the external world, allowing systems to understand environmental dynamics, anticipate outcomes, and make informed decisions. In this talk, we will explore what world models are, how they are built, why they are integral to advancing AI capabilities, and some open challenges. We will delve into popular architectures such as DeepMindâ€™s Dreamer, DIAMOND, and GAIA, highlighting how these frameworks model complex environments. Additionally, we will examine the transformative applications of world models across diverse domains, including autonomous driving, robotics, 3D world simulations, and gaming. By connecting theory to real-world implementations, this talk aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to world models and their pivotal role in shaping the future of intelligent systems.
