        | In the last couple of years, we have witnessed a relevant increase in interest in generative models, mainly sparked by the emergence of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. While image generation remains the most popular task for these models, graph generation has also gained significant traction because of its applications in drug discovery. One major challenge exclusive to graph diffusion models is that, unlike images, the size of the sample (that is, the number of nodes) often plays a significant role in its properties. However, this problem is overlooked by most of the literature, which results in suboptimal results. In this presentation, we discuss some tasks where this overlook needs to be addressed, as well as some possible solutions.
