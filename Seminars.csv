13/02/2026,Matteo Della Bartola,Bridging the Gap: The Convergence of Cloud-Native Serverless and HPC Workloads,"This presentation provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of Serverless for HPC, based on a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of 122 primary studies published between 2017 and early 2025. We examine the convergence of HPC and Cloud-Native paradigms, identifying key use cases dominated by generic framework development (55.7%) and Machine Learning inference (19.7%). Finally, we analyze the critical barriers hindering widespread adoption—including cold start latency, data communication bottlenecks, and state management inefficiencies—and outline the necessary research directions to enable next-generation, high-performance serverless platforms.",Sala Riunioni Ovest,16:00-17:00,https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ODFkN2ZmOGUtY2VkMy00MTY5LTg5OTItNjkyNDk4MTJkNGE0%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%220688d51d-2df7-4498-9b64-17bc4afd1b01%22%7d
20/02/2026,Filippo Magi,MILP: How to solve your (optimization) problems,"In this talk we focus on discrete linear optimization. Starting from a mathematical formulation, we discuss the computational complexity of these problems, highlighting both tractable cases and sources of hardness. We then present two main solution paradigms for discrete optimization problems: dynamic programming and branch-and-bound methods. For dynamic programming, we provide a formal mathematical framework and explain its underlying principles. For branch and bound, we introduce linear relaxations, cutting-plane ideas, and Lagrangian relaxation, discussing their role in improving bounds and algorithmic performance.",Sala Riunioni Ovest,16:00-17:00,https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ODFkN2ZmOGUtY2VkMy00MTY5LTg5OTItNjkyNDk4MTJkNGE0%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%220688d51d-2df7-4498-9b64-17bc4afd1b01%22%7d
